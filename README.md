The brain is one of the largest and most complex organs in the human body and is made up of more than 100 billion nerve cells and trillions of synaptic connections.
Seizures are one of the problems that occur to a large number of people every year in the world, which can be caused by trauma or muscle attack, but most of the time there is no specific reason for it.
Until now, many researches have been done regarding the diagnosis of epilepsy with different methods, but little research has been done regarding the diagnosis of right temporal epilepsy through the analysis of the images received from the MRI machine.
Since the existence of correct and coherent information is one of the It is considered essential for success in modern medical sciences, and information includes two parts: data and knowledge. How to collect, store and retrieve data is studied in database theory.
In knowledge engineering, the main attention is paid to the knowledge of neural network formulation and application methods.
It is in different sciences, inferred knowledge from fields and fields of interest to experts and specialists, or inferred from data sets.
Inferred knowledge is from data sets usually stored in large databases and data mining.
In data mining, new methods are used along with statistical methods. The origin of new methods is artificial intelligence.
In fact, these methods identify unforeseen and unknown relationships between them by exploring data from the database.
In this project, we decided to compare post-surgery seizure methods by implementing KNN, SVM, MLP, LR and RF machine learning algorithms.
Then the implemented algorithms were compared and the capabilities of each were tested and trained.
In this work, patients were first considered as datasets of preoperative and postoperative indicators to identify similarities/differences between disease profiles.
Then, the proposed method for diagnosis of post-seizure disease was investigated using machine learning method and using neural network theory, support vector machine regression and decision tree.
And the goal was to predict NAM. In this research, the algorithms presented in the identification of seizure disease were first investigated.
Finally, the trained information of the machine learning models was calculated and then the results, accuracy and convergence of the algorithms were checked.
It was found that the random forest model is the best proposed model.
As a result, the random forest algorithm was better compared to other models due to data decomposability and overfitting, and as seen, it achieved 0.9% accuracy.
